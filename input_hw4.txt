Sentence: Karyopherin-β2 (also called Transportin-1) engages PY-NLSs to inhibit and reverse FUS, TAF15, EWSR1, hnRNPA1, and hnRNPA2 fibrillization, whereas Importin-α plus Karyopherin-β1 prevent and reverse TDP-43 fibrillization.
Triplet: Karyopherin-β1, prevent, fibrillization

Verb: prevent
Sentence: In vivo, Karyopherin-β2 prevents RBPs with PY-NLSs accumulating in stress granules, restores nuclear RBP localization and function, and rescues degeneration caused by disease-linked FUS and hnRNPA2.
Triplet: Karyopherin-β2, prevents, RBPs

Verb: activate
Sentence: These results demonstrated that serum activates EphA2 and up-regulates twist/VE-cadherin, which in turn activate AKT that up-regulates MMP-2 and LAMC2, thereby inducing the invasion and VM of human PCa PC-3 cells.
Triplet: serum, activates, EphA2
